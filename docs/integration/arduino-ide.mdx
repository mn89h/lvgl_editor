faqs:

  - question: "What is LV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE and why do I need it?"
    answer: "LV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE is a compiler flag that tells LVGL to use simplified includes like #include \"lvgl.h\" instead of #include \"lvgl/lvgl.h\". You need to set this flag in Arduino's platform.txt file to match the include style used by the editor-exported code."
  - question: "Do I need to fix include paths every time I re-export from the editor?"
    answer: "Yes, unfortunately. Each time you re-export from LVGL Editor, the regenerated files overwrite your manual changes. You'll need to update the relative include paths (like ../editor_project.h) in nested files after every export."
  - question: "Can I use LVGL Editor exports with Arduino Uno or Mega?"
    answer: "While technically possible, it's not recommended. Arduino Uno (32KB flash, 2KB RAM) and Mega (256KB flash, 8KB RAM) have very limited resources. LVGL and the editor-generated UI typically require much more memory. Consider using ESP32 or other boards with at least 512KB flash and 80KB+ RAM."
  - question: "Where should I put fonts and images exported from the editor?"
    answer: "Fonts and images should be placed in a filesystem accessible to your board (SD card, SPIFFS, LittleFS, etc.). Pass the base path to editor_project_init(), for example: editor_project_init(\"/editor_project/\"). If not using external assets, pass an empty string."

Integrating LVGL Pro Editor's exported C code into Arduino IDE requires proper folder structure and compiler settings. Arduino's build system has specific rules about where source files must be located to ensure everything compiles together correctly.

## Understanding Arduino's Build System

Arduino IDE automatically compiles:

- The main sketch file (`.ino`)
- All `.c`, `.cpp`, and `.h` files in the sketch directory or `src` subfolder

**Important:** Files placed elsewhere are ignored and won't be compiled.

### Why Exported Projects Need the `src/` Folder

LVGL Editor exports projects with nested folders:

```
screens/
widgets/
components/
```

If you place these folders directly in your sketch directory, Arduino ignores them. Placing the entire exported project inside the `src/` subfolder ensures all files are discovered and compiled.

**Folder Structure:**

```
YourSketch/
├── YourSketch.ino
└── src/
    └── editor_project/
        ├── editor_project.h
        ├── editor_project.c
        ├── screens/
        ├── widgets/
        └── components/
```

## Configuring LVGL Include Paths

LVGL source files use conditional includes:

```c
#ifdef LV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE
    #include "lvgl.h"
#else
    #include "lvgl/lvgl.h"
#endif
```

The `LV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE` define controls which include pattern is used. Arduino IDE doesn't provide UI options to set compiler flags, so you must modify the board core's configuration file directly.

### Setting the LV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE Flag

**Step 1: Locate `platform.txt`**

Find the platform configuration for your board core:

- **ESP32:** `hardware/esp32/esp32/`
- **AVR (Uno, Mega):** `hardware/arduino/avr/`
- **Other boards:** Check your Arduino installation's `hardware/` folder

**Step 2: Edit the File**

Open `platform.txt` in a text editor.

**Step 3: Find and Modify build.extra_flags**

Locate the line: `build.extra_flags=`

Add this flag to the end: `-DLV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE`

**Step 4: Example Modified Line**

```text
build.extra_flags=-DARDUINO_HOST_OS="{runtime.os}" -DARDUINO_FQBN="{build.fqbn}" -DESP32=ESP32 -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL={build.code_debug} {build.loop_core} {build.event_core} {build.defines} {build.extra_flags.{build.mcu}} {build.zigbee_mode} -DLV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE
```

## Fixing Nested File Include Paths

LVGL Editor exports files in nested directories (screens/, widgets/, components/). Files in these subdirectories need relative paths to access the main project header.

**Change this:**

```c
#include "editor_project.h"
```

**To this:**

```c
#include "../editor_project.h"
```

Adjust the number of `../` based on the file's nesting depth. Without correct relative paths, Arduino throws "No such file or directory" compilation errors.

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up your Arduino sketch with LVGL Editor exports:

**Step 1: Create the `src` Folder**

```
YourSketch/
├── YourSketch.ino
└── src/
```

**Step 2: Place Exported Project in `src/`**

Copy your entire LVGL Editor exported project into the `src/` folder:

```
src/
└── editor_project/
    ├── editor_project.h
    ├── editor_project.c
    ├── screens/
    ├── widgets/
    └── components/
```

**Step 3: Update Include Paths**

In all source files within the nested folders, ensure they include LVGL correctly:

```c
#include "lvgl.h"
```

And reference the main project header with relative paths:

```c
#include "../editor_project.h"
```

**Step 4: Handle Re-exports**

Each time you re-export from LVGL Editor, regenerated files overwrite your changes. You must repeat Step 3 after every export to maintain correct include paths.

## Complete Arduino Sketch Example

Here's a working example of an Arduino sketch using LVGL Editor exports:

```cpp
#include <lvgl.h>
#include "src/editor_project/editor_project.h" // Adjust project name as needed

void my_disp_init();
void my_touch_init();

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    lv_init(); // Initialize LVGL library
    my_disp_init(); // Setup display driver
    my_touch_init(); // Setup input/touch driver

    // Initialize the LVGL Editor project
    // The parameter is the asset path (fonts and images location)
    //
    // If you're not loading assets from a filesystem, pass an empty string:
    editor_project_init("");

    // Alternatively, if assets are in a filesystem:
    // editor_project_init("C:/editor_project/");
    //
    // Asset folder structure example:
    // /editor_project/fonts/font.ttf
    // /editor_project/images/image.bin

    // Load the main screen
    lv_screen_load(main_create());
}

void loop() {
    lv_timer_handler(); // Process LVGL timers and input
    delay(5); // Small delay to prevent CPU overload
}
```

### Key Points

- **Include path:** Adjust `src/editor_project/editor_project.h` to match your actual project structure
- **Asset path:** Pass the correct path to `editor_project_init()` based on where your fonts and images are stored
- **lv_timer_handler():** Must be called periodically in your loop to keep LVGL responsive
- **Display & Input drivers:** Implement `my_disp_init()` and `my_touch_init()` for your specific hardware
