title: Figma Integration
description: Leverage the Figma plugin to synchronize designs with LVGL Pro Editor and automate style extraction.
---

LVGL Pro's [Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1362005814860504095/figma-to-lvgl) displays the style properties of selected UI elements, allowing you to copy-paste styles directly into the Editor for pixel-perfect design implementation.

The plugin also shows the "Figma node ID" of each element, enabling automatic style synchronization. With a single click in the Editor or a CLI command, you can download and update style properties from Figma into your XML files.

Since this is not a magical auto-importer, you retain full control over how files, styles, components, and other elements are organized. The designer can work freely in Figma without constraints, while you focus on restructuring the design with a developer mindset to ensure a maintainable, clean, and optimal structure.

## The Figma to LVGL Plugin

The Figma to LVGL Plugin is available publicly in Figma's plugin store
and can be added to both public and private projects, even without a
Figma subscription.

To install the Figma to LVGL Plugin, go to the Figma menu -\> Plugins
-\> Manage plugins and find it in the list.

/>

If you used it earlier, it will appear among the "Recents".

Once it's installed, a small window will appear showing the style
properties of the selected element.

## Usage in the Editor

The style properties listed by the plugin can be copy-pasted into any
XML style section. For example:

``` xml
<component>
 <styles>
 <style name="style_from_figma"
 figma_node_id="1:2" bg_color="0xfb0000"
 border_color="0x4e3535"
 border_opa="255"
 border_width="14"
 width="200"
 height="177"
 radius="13"
 />
 </styles>

 <view>
 <style name="style_from_figma" />
 </view>

</component>
```

## Synchronizing Style Properties

If you copied the `figma_node_id="..."` part from the plugin, the style
in the XML is connected to a specific element in Figma, and the Editor
can download the style properties.

To enable synchronization, add a `project_local.xml` file with the
following content:

``` xml
project_local
 <figma document="XXXXXX" token="YYYYY"/>
</project_local>
```

Where:

- **XXXXXX** - The string after "design" in the Figma URL. For example, if the Figma URL is `https://www.figma.com/design/P8NM0qOqgWfYpbENhAKqYb`, then XXXXXX would be "P8NM0qOqgWfYpbENhAKqYb".

- **YYYYY** - The Personal Access Token that you can generate as described in the [Manage Personal Access Tokens](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens) article in Figma documentation.

Because `project_local.xml` contains a personal token, it should be
added to `.gitignore` and stored only locally.

After that, clicking the FigmaSync button (top right-hand corner) will
update each style with a `figma_node_id` from the latest Figma design.

### Using with the CLI

The CLI tool editor_cli can also
synchronize styles from Figma in CI/CD:

``` bash
lved-cli.js figma-sync path/to/project --start-service
```
