title: XML Format Overview
description: Learn how LVGL's XML format enables declarative UI development with version control, reusability, and runtime flexibility for embedded applications.
---

Describe your embedded UIs in XML instead of code, combining the best of both worlds: the clarity of markup with the power of modern development tools. LVGL's XML Module brings declarative UI programming to embedded systems.

## Why Use XML?

XML offers powerful advantages over traditional drag-and-drop or pure code-based approaches:

- **HTML-like syntax** - Familiar to web developers, easy to learn and read
- **Version control friendly** - Plain text with readable diffs, no binary files
- **Share and collaborate** - Copy, paste, and send XML snippets effortlessly
- **Reusable components** - Build libraries of UI patterns for consistency
- **Automation ready** - Scripts and CI/CD pipelines can process XML automatically
- **AI-powered workflows** - AI tools can read, generate, and refactor your UIs
- **Runtime flexibility** - Parse and load XML at runtime without recompiling
- **Cross-platform** - The same XML works across all LVGL targets
- **Fast iteration** - Quicker to type than drag-and-drop editing

## Working with XML

You can write XML by hand, but we recommend using LVGL Pro's Editor for a better experience.

<Callout type="info">
**Recommended: Use LVGL Pro's Editor**

The Editor provides live preview, inspector tools, code generation, auto-completion, syntax highlighting, validation, online preview and sharing for team feedback, and Figma integration to convert designs directly to XML.

## Core Concepts

XML UIs are built from three fundamental elements: **Widgets**, **Components**, and **Screens**. Understanding the differences is key to effective UI design.

  <ConceptCard
    icon={<Terminal className="w-6 h-6" />}
    title="Widgets"
    description="Fundamental building blocks that compile into C code."
    tag="<widget>"
    characteristics={[
      "Similar to LVGL's built-in widgets",
      "Support custom and complex logic",
      <>Have a large, customizable API with <code>set/get/add</code> functions</>,
      "Compound widgets can contain other widgets (e.g., Tabview, Dropdown)",
      "Cannot be loaded from XML at runtime (custom code isn't loadable)",
      "Use a custom XML parser to map properties to API functions"
    ]}
    whenToUse="Building reusable custom UI elements that need advanced logic or compiled performance."
  />

  <ConceptCard
    icon={<Layout className="w-6 h-6" />}
    title="Components"
    description="Lightweight, XML-only UI elements that load at runtime."
    tag="<component>"
    characteristics={[
      "Built from Widgets and/or other Components",
      "Pure XML—no custom C code (but can call C functions as callbacks)",
      "Support data bindings, animations, and styling",
      "Load from XML at runtime",
      <>Can have a simple API to pass properties to children (e.g., <code>btn_text</code>)</>,
      "Can contain Widgets and/or other Components"
    ]}
    note="LVGL reads Component XML files, learns their structure, and creates instances as needed within Screens and other Components."
    whenToUse="Building reusable UI patterns, styled configurations, and dynamic UI elements."

  <ConceptCard
    icon={<FileCode className="w-6 h-6" />}
    title="Screens"
    description="Top-level containers for complete UI views."
    tag="<screen>"
    characteristics={[
      "Built from Widgets and/or Components",
      "Define complete visual layouts",
      "Load at runtime (visual only, no custom code)",
      "No complex API—properties are for visual styling",
      "Can be referenced in screen load events and navigation"

## Shared Resources with globals.xml

The `globals.xml` file defines project-wide resources accessible throughout your UI:

- **Styles** - Reusable styling definitions
- **Constants** - Project-wide values and settings
- **Images** - Image assets and sprites
- **Fonts** - Font definitions and configurations
- **Subjects** - Data binding sources for reactive updates

You can load multiple `globals.xml` files if needed. They merge into the same global scope, preventing duplicate items.

## Using XML Files

XML files serve two primary purposes:

1. **Runtime loading** - LVGL parses and loads XML directly at runtime
2. **Code generation** - Convert XML to optimized C code using the Editor or CLI

Both workflows are detailed in the Integration section.
