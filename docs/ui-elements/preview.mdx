The preview feature lets you define how components and widgets appear in the Editor's preview pane without affecting the generated code.

## Overview

In `component` and `widget` elements, you can define `preview` tags to customize how the Editor displays your UI. These previews are **not** exported to code and are **not** loaded from XML.

Previews are useful for:

- Changing the preview background to dark or light colors
- Centering components within the preview area
- Setting margins and padding
- Adjusting the preview size and dimensions
- Making preview corners rounded with `style_radius`

## Usage

Think of a `preview` tag as an `lv_obj` container with the following configurable properties:

- `width`, `height` - Set the preview dimensions
- Style properties - Use properties like `style_bg_color="0x333"` to customize appearance
- Layout properties - Use `flex` and `flex_flow` for flexible layouts

You can define multiple previews for a single component or widget. In the Editor, you can switch between different preview configurations to see how your component appears in various contexts.

### For Screens

Screens use a different preview approach than components and widgets. Instead of preview tags, screens leverage multiple `display` elements defined in your `project.xml` file.

When developing screens in the Editor, you can select from all defined displays in the Preview panel. This allows you to:

- View the screen at different resolutions
- Test with different color depths
- Verify responsive design behavior across multiple target hardware configurations

## Example

```xml
<component>
  <previews>
    <preview name="small_dark_round"
      width="240" height="240"
      style_bg_color="0x333" style_pad_all="32"
      style_radius="32"/>

    <preview name="large_light"
      width="1980" height="1080"
      style_bg_color="0xeeeeee"/>
  </previews>

  <view>
    <!-- Component content here -->
  </view>
</component>
```
