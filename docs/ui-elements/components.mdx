Components are powerful XML-based building blocks that let you create reusable, modular UI elements without writing C code.

## Overview

Components are one of the main building blocks for creating new UI elements. Component definitions support the following child XML tags:

- `consts` - Local constants
- `api` - Custom properties and slots
- `styles` - Local styles
- `view` - Component structure
- `previews` - Preview configurations

Although components cannot contain C code, they are very powerful:

- They can extend another Component or Widget (base can be defined)
- Components can be built from Widgets and other Components
- A custom API can be defined
- Local styles can be defined, and global styles can be used
- Local constants can be defined, and global constants can be used
- Function calls, subject changes, or screen load/create events can be added
- Previews can be defined to preview components in various settings in the UI Editor

### Extending Components and Widgets

When a Component is created, it can extend another Component or Widget like `<view extends="lv_slider">`. If a Widget is extended, the component can use the Widget's API, for example:

```xml
<view extends="lv_slider" min_value="20">
```

If a Component is extended, the `api` properties can be used:

```xml
<view extends="my_button" button_text="Apply">
```

### Runtime vs. Code Generation

Unlike Widgets (which are always compiled into the application), Components can either:

1. Be loaded at runtime from XML, or
2. Be exported to C code by LVGL's UI Editor and compiled with the application

## Using Components in XML

### Basic XML Usage

Using Components in XML is very intuitive. The name of the Component can be used as an XML tag in the `view` of other Components, Screens, and Widgets. Component properties are simply XML attributes.

To load Components from files, the XML files must be saved to the device either as data (byte array) or as files. Once the data is saved, each Component can be registered, and instances can be created after that.

```xml
<!-- my_button.xml -->
<component>
  <view extends="lv_button" flex_flow="row">
    <lv_image src="logo"/>
    <my_h3 text="Title"/>
  </view>
</component>
```

Styles, constants, and custom API definitions can also be described in the XML files.

### Registering Components

Once a Component is created (for example, `my_button`), it can be registered by calling either:

- `lv_xml_register_component_from_file("A:lvgl/examples/others/xml/my_button.xml")`
- `lv_xml_register_component_from_data("my_button", xml_data_of_my_button)`

These registration functions process the XML data and store relevant information internally. This is required to make LVGL recognize the Component by name.

The "A:" in the above path is a file system "driver identifier letter" and is used accordingly. When loaded from a file, the file name is used as the Component name. During registration, the `view` of the Component is saved in RAM.

### Creating Component Instances

After registration, a new instance of any registered Component can be created with:

```c
lv_obj_t * obj = lv_xml_create(lv_screen_active(), "my_button", NULL);
```

The created Widget is a normal LVGL Widget that can be used like any other manually-created Widget.

The last parameter can be `NULL` or an attribute list:

```c
/* Can be local */
char * my_button_attrs[] = {
  "x", "10",
  "y", "-10",
  "align", "bottom_left",
  NULL, NULL,
};

lv_obj_t * btn1 = lv_xml_create(lv_screen_active(), "my_button", my_button_attrs);
```

## Exporting Components to Code

If loading XML at runtime is not needed, LVGL's UI Editor can export C and H files from the XML files of the Components. The resulting code is completely self-sufficient and the XML files are not needed anymore. The resulting code is similar to what you could write manually.

The exported code looks like this:

```c
lv_obj_t * component_name_create(lv_obj_t * parent, ...api properties...);
```

where `component_name` is replaced by the Component's XML file name.

When a Component is used in another Component's XML code and the code is exported, this `create` function will be called. This means Components do not have a detailed set/get API but are created with a fixed set of parameters.

If you need to access or modify values dynamically, it is recommended to use data bindings via Subject. You can also call these `..._create()` functions at any time from application code to create new Components on demand.

## Defining Custom Properties

The properties of child elements can be adjusted directly:

```xml
<my_button x="10" width="200"/>
```

However, you can also define custom properties in the `api` tag. These properties can then be passed to any properties of the children by referencing them using `$`. For example:

```xml
<!-- my_button.xml -->
<component>
  <api>
    <prop name="btn_text" type="string"/>
  </api>

  <view extends="lv_button">
    <lv_label text="$btn_text"/>
  </view>
</component>
```

And it can be used like:

```xml
<!-- my_list.xml -->
<component>
  <view>
    <my_button btn_text="First"/>
    <my_button btn_text="Second"/>
    <my_button btn_text="Third"/>
  </view>
</component>
```

In this setup, the `btn_text` property is mandatory. However, you can make it optional by setting a default value:

```xml
<prop name="btn_text" type="string" default="Title"/>
```

See the API documentation for more details and XML syntax reference for all the supported types.

## Complete Examples

The following examples demonstrate parameter passing, styles, and constants in Components.

### Simple Component

```xml
<!-- h3.xml -->
<component>
  <view extends="lv_label" style_text_color="0xffff00"/>
</component>
```

### Advanced Component with Styles and Constants

```xml
<!-- red_button.xml -->
<component>
  <api>
    <prop type="string" name="btn_text" default="None"/>
  </api>

  <consts>
    <int name="thin" value="2"/>
  </consts>

  <styles>
    <style name="pressed_style" border_width="#thin" border_color="0xff0000"/>
  </styles>

  <view extends="lv_button" style_radius="0" style_bg_color="0xff0000">
    <style name="pressed_style" selector="pressed"/>
    <h3 text="Some text"/>
    <h3 text="$btn_text" y="40"/>
  </view>
</component>
```

### Using Components in C Code

```c
lv_xml_register_component_from_file("A:path/to/h3.xml");
lv_xml_register_component_from_file("A:path/to/red_button.xml");

/* Creates a button with "None" text */
lv_xml_create(lv_screen_active(), "red_button", NULL);

/* Use attributes to set the button text */
const char * attrs[] = {
  "btn_text", "Click here",
  NULL, NULL,
};
lv_xml_create(lv_screen_active(), "red_button", attrs);
```
