Create organized, self-contained screens that serve as the main containers for your UI layout and handle screen transitions and state management.

## Overview

Screens work very similarly to Components. Both can be loaded from XML and contain Widgets and Components as children. Screens are wrapped in the `screen` XML root element and organize the content of your UI.

Screens can only have the following child XML tags:

- `consts` - Define constants for reuse within the screen
- `styles` - Define styles and their properties
- `view` - The main content area containing widgets and components

Screens **cannot** have:

- `api` - Screens are always created as-is, with no parameters
- `preview` - In LVGL's UI Editor, preview options for screens are defined in `project.xml`

## Usage

Each XML file describes a Screen. The name of the XML file becomes the Screen's name.

This example illustrates a screen in XML using `my_header` and `my_main_cont` components to keep the structure organized:

```xml
<screen>
 <consts>
  <string name="title" value="Main menu"/>
 </consts>

 <styles>
  <style name="dark" bg_color="0x333"/>
 </styles>

 <view>
  <my_header label="#title"/>
  <my_main_cont>
   <style name="dark"/>
   <button text="Weather" icon="cloudy"/>
   <button text="Messages" icon="envelope"/>
   <button text="Settings" icon="cogwheel"/>
   <button text="About" icon="questionmark"/>
  </my_main_cont>
 </view>
</screen>
```

## Code Export

LVGL's UI Editor can export C code for Screens. It generates `screen_name_gen.c/h` files containing a single create function:

```c
lv_obj_t * screen_name_create(void)
```

Using this function, you can create any number of screen instances and load them as needed.

## Permanent Screens

The `screen` tag supports a `permanent` property that can be `true` or `false` (default). This property affects how screens are managed when transitioning between them.

If a screen is permanent, it remains in memory when a new screen is loaded, preserving its state. Non-permanent screens are automatically deleted and recreated when opened and closed.

Permanent screens are assumed to be created when the UI initializes. When exporting code from the UI Editor, permanent screens are created and stored in global pointers.

**Usage:**
- Permanent screens should be **loaded** using: `<screen_load_event screen="my_permanent_screen"/>`
- Non-permanent screens should be **created** using: `<screen_create_event screen="my_non_permanent_screen"/>`

## Preview

Screens don't support the `preview` tag because it doesn't make sense to preview each screen in different resolutions.

Screens are related to the target hardware defined in the `project.xml` file, where multiple `display` elements can be configured. In the UI Editor, when developing a Screen, you can select from all defined displays in the Preview panel, and the Screen will be shown with the corresponding resolution and color depth.

This is useful for verifying responsive designs across different target devices.

## Events

A common pattern is to load or create Screens in response to user interactions like button clicks. Use special XML tags as children of Components or Widgets:

```xml
<view>
 <lv_button>
  <lv_label text="Click or Long press me"/>

  <!-- Load an instance of "first" screen with fade animation. -->
  <screen_load_event screen="first" trigger="clicked" anim_type="fade"/>

  <!-- Create an instance of "about" screen on long press. -->
  <screen_create_event screen="about" trigger="long_pressed"/>
 </lv_button>
</view>
```
