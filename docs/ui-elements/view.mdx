The `view` tag defines the visual structure and layout for components, widgets, screens, and tests.

## Overview

The `view` tag is used to describe the appearance and structure of:

- `component` elements
- `widget` elements
- `screen` elements
- `test` elements

Within a `view`, you can nest child elements using already-defined widgets and components, creating a hierarchical structure.

### Example: Basic View Structure

```xml
<view>
  <lv_button width="200">
    <my_icon src="image1"/>
    <lv_label text="Click me"/>
  </lv_button>
</view>
```

## Extending Base Elements

### Using the Extends Attribute

The `view` tag itself acts as a container that becomes the parent of all children. You can specify what type of widget or component to use as the base using the `extends` attribute.

For example, `extends="lv_slider"` creates an `lv_slider` first, then adds your child elements to it.

### Example: Extended View

```xml
<view extends="lv_slider" width="100%" style_bg_color="0xff8800" flex_flow="row">
  <style name="my_style" selector="pressed|knob"/>
  <lv_label text="Current value: "/>
  <lv_label bind_text="subject_1"/>
</view>
```

Properties added to the `view` tag customize the extended element's behavior and appearance.

### Extension Rules by Element Type

The `extends` attribute has specific rules depending on which element contains the view:

| Element | Can Extend | Examples |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `component` | Widgets and Components | `extends="lv_button"` or `extends="my_component"` |
| `widget` | Widgets only | `extends="lv_slider"` |
| `screen` | Nothing | (no extends allowed) |
| `test` | Widgets, Components, or Screens | Any of the above |
